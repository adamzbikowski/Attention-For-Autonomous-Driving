# Attention-Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving

Recent advancements in autonomous driving technology have significantly accelerated the exploration of safe and efficient vehicular operation. A critical element in the development of self-driving vehicles is addressing the intricate decision making challenges inherent in autonomous navigation. In this project, we specifically target these challenges by investigating the efficacy of various deep reinforcement learning models—namely, the Deep Q-Network (DQN), Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)—across a series of automated driving tasks. Additionally, we integrate an attention-based framework to enhance the neural network architecture, which optimises our models' ability to process complex environments. Our findings indicate that policy-based algorithms consistently outperform value-based ones in terms of safety and efficiency during training phases.
